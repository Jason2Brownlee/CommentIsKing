## About

**Comment is King**: __Tap into the broader conversation__

"The conversation has left the blogsphere", meaning that increasing the conversations regarding online content are occurring offsite.

Comment is King is an online tool for blog authors and other context producers for finding and participating in the broader conversations around their content from disparate services such as Reddit, Digg, Delicious, FriendFeed, and Twitter.

Comment is King is a free service with no immediate plans to monetise.

Content producers currently resort to ad hoc searches, alerts, and generally manually tracking broader conversations around their content across the web.

The core competitive advantage is the automation of the process to consolidate relevant broader conversations from high-profile services across the web into a single comment stream.


## Code

The website was developed in Ruby on Rails and connected to a suite of social media sources using public APIs.

A snapshot of the code was collected late 2009. A dump of the database was not archived.

The converation view for a given URL looked really good. I cannot find any screenshots of the site from back then to show it off. Oh well.
